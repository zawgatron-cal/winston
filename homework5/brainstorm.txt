Gravitational wave detection

2. Related Sources for Three Topics
(a) Star Clusters and Galactic Structure
Source: Milky Way Star Clusters (MWSC) Catalog — NASA HEASARC Database
This dataset lists positions, distances, and magnitudes of known star clusters. It’s directly relevant because it provides real astronomical data to analyze galactic patterns.
(b) Exoplanet Detection using Light Curves
Source: NASA Exoplanet Archive (Kepler Mission)
The archive provides light intensity vs. time data from thousands of stars. By analyzing periodic dips in brightness, scientists can detect planets orbiting other stars — a great example of data science in astrophysics.
(c) Gravitational Wave Detection
Source: LIGO Open Science Center
This repository shares real interferometer strain data from gravitational wave detections. It shows how signals are extracted from noisy data — a fascinating application of signal processing and statistics in physics.

3. Chosen Topic: Star Clusters and Galactic Structure
I could use Python skills to 
Read and clean data from a CSV catalog using pandas.
Loop through clusters to compute derived quantities (e.g., luminosity).
Use conditionals to filter clusters by brightness or distance.
Store results in lists or dictionaries for further analysis.
Track changes with Github

4. Two Possible Project Ideas
Ambitious (“Dream”) Version:
Build an interactive 3D map of Milky Way star clusters, showing spatial distribution and brightness in real-time using matplotlib or plotly.
Simpler, Realistic Version:
Analyze a CSV dataset of star clusters using pandas and NumPy to compute basic statistics (average distance, brightness distribution) and produce clear 2D visualizations (scatter plots, histograms).
